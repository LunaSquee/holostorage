# Storagetest
A solution to your hoarding addiction. In [Minetest](http://minetest.net).

This mod is an attempt at re-creating [Refined Storage](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage) 
in Minetest. I can't promise that this will ever be completed, but we'll see. Help is always welcome.

Currently, it is geared towards and developed in Minetest 0.5.0+, backports are not planned right now.
